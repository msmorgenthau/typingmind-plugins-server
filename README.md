## üåü Introduction

Plugins Server provides additional features for [TypingMind's Plugins](https://docs.typingmind.com/plugins) where extra server-side processing is needed.

Plugins Server is used by some built-in plugins on Typing Mind (e.g., Web Page Reader). Other plugins can also make use of the existing endpoints of the Plugins Server if needed. New endpoints can be added via Pull Requests.

Plugins Server is open-sourced and is intended to be self-hosted by individual users for private use only.

**Note**: The Plugins Server only provides an endpoint for retrieving server-side processing results. To make the plugin work, you must also install a TypingMind's plugin configured to send requests to this server endpoint.

## üîå How to use (for Typing Mind users)

Two simple steps:

1. Deploy this repo on any hosting provider that supports NodeJS (e.g., Render.com, AWS, etc.). (We also provide a Dockerfile for easy deployment on Docker-supported hosting providers).

2. Install your desired TypingMind's plugin. Update the server endpoint URL in your Settings page.

Follow this guide for detailed instructions: [How to Deploy Plugins Server on Render.com](https://docs.typingmind.com/plugins/plugins-server/how-to-deploy-plugins-server-on-render)

Follow this guide for setting up a TypingMind's plugin: [Build a TypingMind Plugin](https://docs.typingmind.com/plugins/build-a-typingmind-plugin)

## List of available endpoints

After deploying, visit your Plugins Server URL to see the list of available endpoints (served in Swagger UI).

In your local development environment, visit http://localhost:3000 to access the page.

**Note**: this public server only hosts the API documentation. You cannot use this Public Server as your proxy. You must deploy your own Plugins Server to use all the available endpoints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development (for Typing Mind plugins developers)

- **Development Mode:** To start the project in development mode, execute the following command in your terminal:
